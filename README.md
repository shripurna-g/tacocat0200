## About Me

Hi, I’m Shripurna 👋  

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer who designs clean, scalable systems for high-noise, niche problems.

My core interest lies in building **reliable, graceful systems** for domains where definitions are fuzzy, data is messy, and stakes are high. That curiosity has led me across problems in:
- disease prediction & biomarker discovery  
- drought-resistant crop development  
- telomere biology & ancient DNA  
- fraud detection & algorithm design

🔹 I care about design principles and making complex ideas **deployable**, **maintainable**, and **elegant**  
🔹 My tools include: Python, CUDA, Shell, Bash, Git workflows, AWS
🔹 Currently: Intern @ Nielsen (multimodal segmentation for ad-intel) | upcoming Data Scientist @ Commonwealth Bank of Australia (fraud detection at scale)  
<!-- Also: Co-authoring a metagenomics paper and contributing to open source-->

If you're working on strange problems that need smart systems - let’s talk.
